# Preface
EN 419211-2:2013 - Protection profiles for secure signature creation device - Part 2: Device with key generation
is prepared by Technical Committee CEN/TC 224 "Personal identification, electronic signature and cards and their related systems and operations".

# Security Functional Requirement - FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation)
This Protection Profile includes Security Functional Requirement FPT_EMS in order to meet security objective OT.SCD_Secrecty Secrecy of the signature creation data.

It is stated that the FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) was taken from [BSI-PP-0006-2002, Protection Profile - Secure Signature-Creation Device Type 3, Version 1.05](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Zertifizierung/Reporte/ReportePP/PP0006b_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1).

In [BSI-PP-0006-2002](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Zertifizierung/Reporte/ReportePP/PP0006b_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1), the Security Functional Requirement (SFR) was referred to as FPT_EMSEC (TOE Emanation).

The SFR is imposed to prevent attacks using simple power analysis (SPA), differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, etc.

FPT_EMS.1.1 focuses on the limit of emission, which captures the nature of physical phenomena.
The actual protection mechanisms beyond SFR or beyond TOE Summary Specification would be using software-level countermeasures (e.g. hiding, masking), and/or hardware-level countermeasures (e.g. dual-rail logic).

Here we would like to see how other protection profiles address this threat, emission.
The threat of emission is referred to as T.Leak-Inherent in [BSI-CC-PP-0084 Security IC Platform Protection Profile with Augmentation Packages](https://commoncriteriaportal.org/nfs/ccpfiles/files/ppfiles/pp0084b_pdf.pdf) and in [BSI-CC-PP-0035 Security IC Platform Protection Profile](https://commoncriteriaportal.org/nfs/ccpfiles/files/ppfiles/pp0035b.pdf).
In order to counter T.Leak-Inherent, security objective O.Leak-Inherent is set which will be mapped to the following three SFRs:
- FDP_ITT.1 "Basic internal transfer protection"
- FPT_ITT.1 "Basic internal TSF data transfer protection"
- FDP_IFC.1 "Subset information flow control"

This set of SFRs defines the Data Processing Policy between electronic components such as memories, CPU.
It may fit information leak from data bus transfer, but may not fit information leak from inside CPU, or from inside cryptographic co-processor.  
Therefore it does not perfectly fit forementioned countermeasures.

The threat of emission is included as a part of T.Physical_Attack in [JISEC-C0737 - Protection Profile for ePassport IC with SAC (PACE) and Active Authentication](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/nfs/ccpfiles/files/ppfiles/c0737_epp.pdf) and in [JISEC-C0738 - Protection Profile for ePassport IC with SAC (BAC+PACE) and Active Authentication](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/nfs/ccpfiles/files/ppfiles/c0738_epp.pdf).
In order to counter T.Physical_Attack, security objective O.Physical_Attack is set which will be mapped to SFR FPT_PHP.3 Resistance to physical attack.
This SFR states "responding automatically", but does not appropriately representing the nature of countermeasures by taking into account that forementioned countermeasures are suppressing leak without any intervention by attackers.

Back to EN 419211-2:2013, the defined SFR FPT_EMS does fit forementioned countermeasures, and does not have issues in above protection profiles.
