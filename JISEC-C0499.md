# Introduction

JISEC-C0499 was developed by Passport Division, Consular Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, evaluated by ECSEC Laboratory, an Evaluation Facility in Japan, and certified by JISEC, CC Certification Body in Japan.

# Section 6.1.11 FCS_RND.1 Quality standards for random numbers
In Note 6-5, it is stated that "the ST author shall iterate this requirement ...".

Recently new [Security Target](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/nfs/ccpfiles/files/epfiles/NSCIB-CC-2300104-01-ST.pdf) was released claiming conformance to this PP.

In the Security Target, FCS_RND appears only once and "Class PTG2 of the AIS31" is assigned to "defined quality standard",
and it is claimed that the random numbers for "ephemeral key pairs generation" are generated by using the TRNG, under Section 8.2.2.

- It is stated that FCS_CKM.1e depends on FCS_CKM.1/EC-3 in the [platform security target]().
- The referenced FCS_CKM.1/EC-3 claims conformance to ANSI X9.62-2005 in the [platform security target](),
- ANSI X9.62-2005 requests approved random number generator conforming to ANSI X9.82 standard.
Here ANSI X9.82 standard specifies NRBG and DRBG, however, there is no approved NRBG conforming to ANSI X9.82 standard.

From the above, the unique solution is to use DRBG, or hybrid RNG as in AIS31, for random number generation to be used inside elliptic curve key pair generation.

If so, FCS_CKM.1e shoud use hybrid RNG, while the DRNG is not associated with any SFR in the [Passport Security Target](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/nfs/ccpfiles/files/epfiles/NSCIB-CC-2300104-01-ST.pdf), therefore the DRNG is considered not SFR-enforcing.
